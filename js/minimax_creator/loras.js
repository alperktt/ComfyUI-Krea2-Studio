// control writes straight through to creator_data and the only exit is Done.
//
// Cards come from models/loras. Everything above the filename — showcase image,
// title, base model, trigger words — comes from whatever sidecars are beside the
// file, which is `lorameta.py`'s problem rather than this file's: half a dozen
// tools write half a dozen layouts and they all arrive here as one row shape. A
// LoRA nothing has ever described still gets a working card from its filename.
//
// A real collection is hundreds or thousands of files, so the grid never holds
// all of them: a folder picker narrows what the server even walks, and what
// comes back is appended a screenful at a time as you scroll.

// checkpoints and then never again — so they get one pill at the end of the
// sampler row rather than a row of their own, and the popover is where the six
// choices live.
//
// The pill is the only thing that changes shape: with everything picked it says
// what precision it is running at, and with a required file missing it says so
// in the same warm orange the resolution slider uses past 768. That is not a
// decoration — `models.check` refuses the render on exactly this list, and the
// difference between finding out here and finding out at queue time is a minute
// of your life.
